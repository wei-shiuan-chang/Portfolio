            Music and sports are what I devote my spare time to pursue my interests. Unlike most teenagers, I practiced and was willing to pursue my potential and best performance after or before school hours. To prove myself in teams and balance my study, I need to take efforts to do right things at right time, <strong class="text-black">managing my schedule well and be patient when I face to tough time</strong>.<br /><br /> I always need to practice many hours for just a few second on stages and games. Many students decide to focus on their studies but I consider these experiences as best opportunities to <strong class="text-black">develop grit and shape myself as the person who is willing to take risk and stick to what seems difficult in my life</strong>. I would rather try and fail but not accept what seems accessible to me.

    					<h2>C</h2>
    					<span class="position">National Central University</span>
    					<p class="mt-4">My biggest C programming project was completed as an undergraduate. After constructing a breadboard circuit, I used C to control an electrical system that included LED 7-segment displays to indicate numbers of images according to my instructor's requirements, as well as to track a self-propelled vehicle. This task required several hundred lines of code. It was my first project involving skills from several different topic areas. The sense of fulfillment I felt gave me the first thoughts that I might want to pursue professional-level knowledge in the dual fields of mechanical and software engineering.</p>

    					<p class="mt-4">As the leader of a group working on a theory-focused project in a Numeric Analysis course, I was responsible for organizing input from my classmates and preparing it for presentations. This task required strong negotiation proficiency. Also, as I mentioned in my online application form, I served as the organizer and captain of a department basketball team as an undergraduate. In this position I had to assess the strengths of each player and use my observations to create a teamwork mentality. This is where I developed strong communication skills.</p>

    					<span class="position">National Central University</span>
    					<p class="mt-4">I used Java as a tool in a graduate-level Data Structure and Algorithms course at NTU. I had to complete 12 homework assignments, each one requiring several hundred lines of code and knowledge of Java's algorithm sorting function. These assignments, which reflected real-world engineering graph problems, required the visualization of concepts such as convex hulls and particle collisions. Afterwards, I applied the principles I learned to construct individual parts for some simple games-for example, a collision detection routine for bouncing balls against walls or moving blocks. </p>

    					<span class="position">National Central University</span>
    					<p class="mt-4">My first MATLAB experience was for an undergraduate project developing a mechanism for placing materials in precise positions to meet manufacturing process requirements. I learned about balancing software and hardware guidelines, and discovered that solutions that seem optimal on paper might not work in real-world conditions. The project made me excited about code, but I had to focus on my major. After graduating I spent time developing programming skills via online courses sponsored by Udemy, Harvard ("Introductory CS50"), and Princeton ("Algorithms"). </p>

    					<p class="mt-4">One project, involving a driverless electric car, is aimed at a 2020 competition to be held in Dubai. My responsibility is helping design a comfortable and safe suspension system. As the largest project I have ever worked on, it is challenging my ability to use engineering software. In addition, for my thesis work I am assisting with a project optimizing electric transit bus efficiency using different combinations of motors, transmissions, and batteries. For both projects I am using the MATLAB programming language. Since cars have multiple components, I need to consider how the functions I'm responsible for fit in with all other functions. In other words, I need to think in system terms.</p>

    					<h2>Global Innovation</h2>
    					<span class="position">National Taiwan University</span>
    					<p class="mt-4">I enrolled in the course "Principles and Practices of Global Innovation". Other than traditional courses whose participants have similar backgrounds and academic-related courses that use exams to assess student learning outcome. This course emphasized the importance of cross-cultural interactions in developing innovative products and business ideas in our rapidly globalizing world. I attended lectures that use videoconferencing technology to facilitate live interactions with classmates around the world. Participating the globally virtual teams to exchange perspectives and working collaboratively for innovative projects. This course gave me opportunity to collaborate with students from top-ranking universities, such as USC from United State, Aachen University in Germany, KAIST from South Korea, Peking University and Jiao-Tong University from China.
